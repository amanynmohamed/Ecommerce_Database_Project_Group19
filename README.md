# E-commerce Database Design Project

## 🎯 Objective
This project is part of a peer group 19 assignment aimed at mastering database design concepts.  
We collaboratively designed an *E-commerce database* and an *Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)* from scratch.

## 🛠️ What We Did
- Designed an *ERD* including entities, attributes, primary and foreign keys, and relationships.
- Created the *ecommerce.sql* file containing all table creation statements.
- Planned the data flow between entities.
- Collaborated as a team using *GitHub* for version control and documentation.

## 🗃️ Tables Created
- *product_image* — Stores product image URLs or file references.
- *color* — Manages available color options.
- *product_category* — Classifies products into categories.
- *product* — Stores general product details (name, brand, base price).
- *product_item* — Represents purchasable items with specific variations.
- *brand* — Stores brand-related data.
- *product_variation* — Links a product to its variations (size, color).
- *size_category* — Groups sizes into categories.
- *size_option* — Lists specific sizes.
- *product_attribute* — Stores custom product attributes.
- *attribute_category* — Groups attributes into categories.
- *attribute_type* — Defines attribute types (text, number, boolean).
